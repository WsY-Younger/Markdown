### The Love

- As a grown-up person, he has just stepped into the university campus and is full
 of curiosity and hope for everything unknown. Before the age of eighteen, we all
 knew what it was like, what love is. For the subtle feelings between men and
 women, our hearts are constantly trying to love and avoiding love.
This is a wonderful opportunity to boldly let go of yourself, no longer tangled,
 brave to love, to pursue the girl, maybe the moment when this life is really
alive is that moment. The process of pursuing is more meaningful than the
outcome. Learn to rationally accept the results that are willing to bear for
this, not to lose control and go crazy, IQ will drop sharply, will not affect
 your life, affect your future, will not buy drunk for this late night, this is
the correct way to open love, is Love should look like.
Haruki Murakami once said that you have to be an unrestrained adult, not allowed
to be emotional, not allowed to secretly miss, not allowed to look back. I have
been to my own life. You have to be obedient, not all fish will live in the same
sea.
I have been given to those children, and now I am an adult. I hope that you will
not let your body go for love, but also learn to let go.
 

- 作为刚刚成年的人,刚刚步入大学校园，对未知的一切都充满了好奇和希望。十八岁以前，我们都已经知道了什么是喜欢，爱又是什么，对于男女之间细微的感觉，我们的心也在不断地去尝试着爱，也在躲避着爱。
这是一个绝妙的机会，去大胆的放开自己，不再纠结，勇敢去爱，去追求那个女孩，也许这一辈子真正活着的时候就是那一瞬间。追求的过程比结果更有意义。学会理性地接受一切甘愿为此承担的结果，不会失控发疯，智商急剧下降，不会影响自己的生活，影响自己的未来，不会为此深夜买醉，这才是爱正确的打开方式，是爱应有的样子。
村上春树曾说，你要做一个不动声色的大人了，不准情绪化，不准偷偷想念，不准回头看。去过自己另外的生活。你要听话，不是所有的鱼都会生活在同一片海里。
送给那些孩子，如今已是大人了 希望你们为爱奋不顾身，也要学会去放手死心
